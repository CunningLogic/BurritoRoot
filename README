BurritoRoot is a root exploit for the Kindle Fire, released to gain root on the 6.2.1 firmware. Originally
licensed under a proprietary license, we re-released under the GPL due to blatant code theft by the author
of 'unlockroot'. Not only is he a thief, but a moron, hell he stole the unroot code of our's that was broken.

How it all works

In /sbin/adbd is a secondary property check to see if adbD can run as root, "service.root.amazon.allow". Normally
this can only be set by a system or root process.

.rodata:000203EC aService_root_0 DCB "service.root.amazon.allow",0
.rodata:000203EC                                         ; DATA XREF: .text:0000EFECo
.rodata:00020406                 ALIGN 4
.rodata:00020408 a1_0            unicode 0, <1>,0        ; DATA XREF: .text:0000EFF0o
.rodata:00020408                                         ; .text:0000F000o
.rodata:0002040C aAdbdCannotRunA DCB "adbd cannot run as root in production builds",0xA,0
.rodata:0002040C                                         ; DATA XREF: .text:0000EFF4o
.rodata:0002043A                 ALIGN 4
.rodata:0002043C aService_adb__1 DCB "service.adb.root",0 ; DATA XREF: .text:0000EFFCo
.rodata:0002044D                 ALIGN 0x10
.rodata:00020450 aRestartingAdbd DCB "restarting adbd as root",0xA,0
.rodata:00020450                                         ; DATA XREF: .text:0

In Services.jar is the BroadcastReveiver com.lab126.services.EasterEggReceiver that allows the above property to
be set with a broadcast from any application.

<snippet>
.method private enable(Z)V
    .locals 2
    .parameter "enabled"

    .prologue
    .line 47
    if-eqz p1, :cond_0

    const-string v1, "1"

    move-object v0, v1

    .line 49
    .local v0, value:Ljava/lang/String;
    :goto_0
    const-string v1, "service.root.amazon.allow"

    invoke-static {v1, v0}, Landroid/os/SystemProperties;->set(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;)V

    .line 51
    return-void

    .line 47
    .end local v0           #value:Ljava/lang/String;
    :cond_0
    const-string v1, "0"

    move-object v0, v1

    goto :goto_0
.end method
</snipper>

After causing this property to be set, the user can simply do "adb root" and then adbD will run as root.
